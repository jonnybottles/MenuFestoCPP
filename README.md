# MenuFesto
MenuFesto is a play on the word "manifesto", which refers to a public declaration of policy and aims, especially one issued before an election by a political party or candidate.

MenuFesto is a C++ menu library that has a clear, defined purpose (much like a manifesto) and set of features to provide for creating and managing menus.
